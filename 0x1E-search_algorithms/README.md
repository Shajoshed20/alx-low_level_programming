# 0x1E.C - Search Algorithms

## General Learning Objectives :page_with_curl:

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tasks 

* Task 0 - Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
    - Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
    - Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
    - size is the number of elements in array
    - And value is the value to search for
    - Your function must return the first index where value is located
    - If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
    - Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
